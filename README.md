# Web application environment setup
---

## Description
It gets too repetitive at times to setup your project environment, it's at most cases very a quick and easy task to do, but sometimes it can get pretty messy. Here's an executable file to help you out, while not anything remarkable, it does save time, you're only a click away from setting up a basic web application environment, consisting of an *HTML*, a **javascript**, and a **CSS** file.

## Usage
> At the very first time of opening the file do the following:
- Open the *.bat* file with any text editor.
- Change the `author`'s variable to yours.
- Save the changes.

> Once you've changed the author's name to yours, you may freely use the executable as follows:
- Run the *.bat* file.
- Input your project's name.

Done, how fast was that? a folder with your project's name will be created, containing 3 subfolders, images, styles, and scripts. all three are pretty self-explanatory, the **CSS** file is by default containing reset instructions for the global padding and margin, and the **HTML** file contains the typical HTML format to start with.
